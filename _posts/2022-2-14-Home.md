Data Science works inline with Atificial Intelligence. Briefly Artificial Intelligence is field that involves developing models that think and act like humans, to some extent holding human concious. Initially these models are programed by scientists but eventually some are exposed to learn from the environment and the more they learn, the higher the human concious levels.
