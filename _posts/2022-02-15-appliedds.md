<p>In the modern medical sector today, a variety of data science tools are being utilised in disease diagnosis, Drug discovery, model training among others.
In union with Biomedical Engineering, many technolovical prototypes are currently being explored globally in various laboratories and the majority are powered by technological methods, Artificial Intelligence algorithms and Quantum integrations in order to ensure that they produce the best test results.
Eventually these models are deployed after several tests so that they address the available biological and clinical problems.</p>
<p>Bioinformatics also utilises big data and artificial Intelligence to process DNA Sequencing, DNA editing and Protein manipulation using the 'acgt' character notation. In the past generations these technologies were not yet invented which highly hidered biological research advancements because all thoughts
Had to come from the human head. Though in the present days, due to Tech Advancements, Big data processing is nolonger a problem, and this has led to social-Economic developments in seral countries.Also it has paved way for advanced research in all sectors.
